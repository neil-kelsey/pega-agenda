This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Brain dump of things to improve

Fully width functionality is fun and useful but hard coded to category-2 - expand this to be dynamic
Category styling again is hard coded - I'd like to give options to set your own colours for your categories
colour guide modal
select list styling
filter functionality
Boxes match height in list view
Reusable testing data - I've recreated lots of the test data in the tests, would be nice to have a universal test data set
Talk about how modals could have loads more details like location and speaker name etc which is why a modal is needed
Accessibility - I have done an accessibility audit using the Wave audit tool and there are no errors, not even a contrast error. There are likely improvements I could make given more time
Text strings

TODO
Responsive styling
delete unneeded files - images etc
CSS modules
Code review
Create README
YouTube video
Test on other laptop
